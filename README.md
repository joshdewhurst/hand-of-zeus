# MVP Goals

- [ ] create a system that logs a user in and allows them to manage a system
- [ ] create edit/delete/create for a datapoint "god" that the admin can edit
- [ ] create an auth for the admin

# Stretch Goals

- [ ] set up HTML to show my database using WebAssembly
- [ ] allow specific users to log in and edit their information but not other users and have different options than an admin
