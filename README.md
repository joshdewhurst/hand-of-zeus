### a description of the app

I am going to create a database management system that in similar to an employee management system, but going to put a fun spin on it and have it be a Greek god management system called The Hand of Zues, where Zues, the admin, is able to perform different oporations to change the systems' data. C++ libraries will be used to track operations that create a new entry, delete an entry, or edit an entry within the database.

## wireframes of the app

I am not sure how the app will look as I am not sure how to integrate C++ to a web or mobile app front end framework yet. I have been doing studying and am not sure what the wireframe will yet look like. It looks like I can use WebAssembly to create an HTML file that shows my system on a web interface. But, C++ in a competitive langage that is primarily used for its performance on the backend, and running a front end application with C++ would be redundant since Javascript would need to be used and would be faster in that contect.

# MVP Goals

[] create a system that logs a user in and allows them to manage a system
[] create edit/delete/create for a datapoint "god" that the admin can edit
[] create an auth for the admin

# Stretch Goals

[] set up HTML to show my database using WebAssembly
[] allow specific users to log in and edit their information but not other users and have different options than an admin
